This is a manifesto in the style of Marinetti’s *Italian Futurism* and Marx’s *Communist Manifesto* and André Breton’s *Manifesto of Surrealism* and Ted Kaczynski’s *Industrial Society and its Future* and the manifesto of the Situationists and Legacy Russell’s *Glitch Feminism* and Kropotkin and Grave’s *Manifesto of the Sixteen* and Andrea Long Chu’s *Females* and in the easy and fraternal manner of Y Tu Mama Tambien’s *Charolastras*. And it goes as follows:

(1) All contributors are **EXHIBITIONISTS** and all readers **VOYEURS**

(3) All **EXHIBITIONISTS** should be anonymous, identified only by their pseudonym

(4) A **VOYEUR** can become a **EXHIBITIONIST** if solicited to by another **EXHIBITIONIST**

(5) No **EXHIBITIONIST** should be too shady or fascist or boring or neoliberal or str8-cis

(2) The **DICTATOR** - the master-originator of the zine - reserves the responsibility to collate, compile, censor, and enact the publication of each issue

(6) All copies of the issue should be made to put in consistent circulation by whatever means necessary

(7) Plagiarism for a piece is completely allowed, if distributed by one of those mega-conglomerate monopolies or w-e (Penguin, Harper Collins, Hachette etc)

(8) All **EXHIBITIONISTS** are invited to access the materials through the shared Google Drive and participate in a dialogic net-space (a spider-web or 網) on Signal

(9) The Manifesto should be revised by a nominated **EXHIBITIONIST** to reflect the pieces and be re-published at the beginning of each issue

(10) Modesty is a sin, exposure a virtue—
